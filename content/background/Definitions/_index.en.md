The original descriptions of the CGM referred to it as “a data collection and reduction technique” ([Davis, 1981](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0167-9457(91%2990046-Z)) and an "an algorithm for computing lower extremity joint motion" ([Kadaba, 1990](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jor.1100080310)). There is a strong argument that, as originally described, the CGM, is not actually a biomechanical model. This page thus aims to describe the concepts in a manner which is consistent with both the original description and a contemporary understanding of biomechanical modelling.

The mode is best described in five stages:

1. [basic kinematic chain]({{< relref "kinematic Chain" >}})
2. [Definition of the segments]({{< relref "Segments" >}})
3. [Description of placement of markers]({{< relref "MarkerSet" >}})
4. [Description of model outputs]({{< relref "Model outputs" >}})
5. [Variants]({{< relref "Variants" >}})
