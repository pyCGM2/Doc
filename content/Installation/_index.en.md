pyCGM2 was implemented to interact with Vicon Nexus and Qualisys QTM.  

{{< notice "info" >}}
"If your company is interested in integrating PyCGM2 in your software, we would be delighted to assist you and invite you to contact us through the contact form."
{{< /notice >}}


pyCGM2 is already integrated as third-party package in Vicon Nexus and Qualisys QTM. 
Therefore, no need to install pycgm2, the nexus ( resp. QTM) operator can refer to the official documentation :    

* [Vicon](https://docs.vicon.com/display/Nexus214/Modeling+with+CGM2) documentation 
* [Qualisys](https://docs.qualisys.com/clinical-gait/en/index.html)  documents

to know how to use the package.

Althought, the integrated version was tested by Vicon and Qualisys developers, the integrated package  does not allow for the full utilization of PyCGM2's capabilities, such as graphical plotting,  use of the API, etc.. It also does not provide access to the latest version available on Github. If you want to take advantage of all the features of the latest version of PyCGM2, we recommend installing pyCGM2 separately. It is what we cover in this website
