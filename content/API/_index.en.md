### Change log

[Change Log]({{< ref "changeLog" >}} "ChangeLog")


### Documentation API

Though it is ongoing, the Documentation API does not cover the whole package yet.

Instead, We  focus the documentation on the *high level functions* gathered into the module `Lib` of  pyCGM2.

These *high-level functions* are easier to understand and transposable to his own pratice, even for a non-experienced python programmer.

As you will see in the next sections, these functions were implemented on common pratices in 3D clinical gait analysis    


{{< notice "tip" >}}
   For impatient user who want to dive into the package,<br>
   we recommand  to read documentation of the `Lib` module first, then, to read each line of lib-module function to find out the low level classes used in pyCGM2
